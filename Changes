              Haml Whitespace Semantics Extension (WSE Haml) Implementation Notes

              Proposes a set of extensions to Haml whitespace semantics, including:
              mixed content, plaintext nesting, improved semantics for vertical
              whitespace, an alternative preformatted facility without newline
              transform, HereDoc content model, and relaxed indentation under
              an Orderly Indentation Rule.

              In addition to Notes (markdown, pod, html), includes RSpec suite
              for all examples in Notes, plus a dozen-plus topic-specific test
              files on WSE Haml extensions, GitHub and OS Issues, and bugs, nits,
              and inconsistencies in the whitespace handling of legacy Haml.
